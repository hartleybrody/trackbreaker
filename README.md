Track Breaker
========

[Track Breaker is a Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cibjenpiogkojegdeiefhcllldhbedkk/) that automatically prevents email tracking pixels from loading. Specifically, it is designed to block the "read receipt" type tracking from apps like Yesware, Signals (HubSpot) and Streak.

Email is an asynchronous communication tool. Instant read receipt notifications create artificial social pressure for the recipient of an email to respond immediately. The extension avoids that bad user experience.

With Gmail's [recent announcement](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/images-now-showing.html) that all email images will be loaded by default, this is an even bigger issue than ever before.
